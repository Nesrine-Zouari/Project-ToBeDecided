Protecting your privacy
Who you talk to and what you share should be up to you. We're dedicated to making sure that Messenger is a safe, private and secure place for you to connect with the people who matter. To do this, we've built tools that allow you to stay in control, secure your account and stay safe on the platform.

An extra layer of security with end-to-end encryption
As part of our ongoing commitment to privacy and safety, we've started to roll out default end-to-end encryption across personal chats on Messenger. That means that messages and calls can only be seen or heard by you and the person you send them to, and no one else – not even us – can access those chats, unless you report them.

Your personal messages are private.
We want you to know how we use your information. We collect information from Messenger so that we can improve the product experience and keep people safe and secure. We don't use the content of your personal messages for ads personalisation. Some types of messages that aren't personal include messages to and from business accounts, messages exchanged with Meta when using products such as Meta AI and messages in features designed to be more public, such as channels. Meta is also adding an additional layer of privacy by securing personal messages and calls on Messenger with end-to-end encryption, which means nobody, including Meta, can see or listen to what's sent or said in your calls or messages.

BUILT WITH SAFETY BY DESIGN
Messenger has tools to help keep you safe and in control of your own experience.
Messenger's approach to safer private messaging:
Preventing harm
at the source
Preventing harm from happening in the first place is the best way to keep people safe.
Giving you more choice and control
In addition to our efforts to prevent harm, we are giving you more control of your messaging inbox to account for the variety of experiences you want.
Responding
with care
When we become aware of potential abuse on our services, we respond. We do this by enforcing our Community Standards, sharing data with NCMEC and our law enforcement agencies.
HELPING TO KEEP YOU SAFE
Messenger helps to keep you safe online.
That's why we're constantly working to stop malicious activity before it reaches you.
Here are the ways we work to protect your safety on Messenger:
Reduce unwanted interactions
We filter potentially harmful messages so they don't reach your inbox. Safety notices may pop up in your chats to help you spot potential scams or imposters, and we detect and block millions of fake accounts on Facebook every day.
Control who you let in
Messenger continuously innovates to protect you from harm, and tools like multi-block help you control your experience. You decide who reaches your Chats list, who goes to your message request folder, and who can't message or call you at all.
Reduce the spread of misinformation
To help reduce the spread of viral misinformation and harmful content, we limit the number of chats that a message can be forwarded to at one time. We also have additional protections in place for content that has been identified as misinformation on Facebook and shared directly in Messenger. For more information, see How Facebook protects elections.
Foster a safer community
If you come across possible harmful content or behaviour, such as harassment or impersonation, please report it. If we see that it violates our Community Standards, we'll take appropriate action, which could include disabling their account or limiting their ability to send messages.
Enhance safeguards for minors
Keeping minors safe on our platforms is one of our greatest responsibilities. We automatically provide enhanced safety features for minors, such as limiting who can message them and how they can be found in search, and offer them education and resources. We also use machine learning to detect and disable accounts who are engaging in inappropriate interactions with children.
Review and enforce
Reporting is an essential tool for responding to abuse effectively and preventing further harm. Reports are prioritised based on the severity of harm, which allows us to respond quickly to issues such as exploitation or child safety.

"HELPING TO KEEP YOU SAFE
Messenger helps to keep you safe online.
That's why we're constantly working to stop malicious activity before it reaches you.
Here are the ways we work to protect your safety on Messenger:
Reduce unwanted interactions
We filter potentially harmful messages so they don't reach your inbox. Safety notices may pop up in your chats to help you spot potential scams or imposters, and we detect and block millions of fake accounts on Facebook every day.
Control who you let in
Messenger continuously innovates to protect you from harm, and tools like multi-block help you control your experience. You decide who reaches your Chats list, who goes to your message request folder, and who can't message or call you at all.
Reduce the spread of misinformation
To help reduce the spread of viral misinformation and harmful content, we limit the number of chats that a message can be forwarded to at one time. We also have additional protections in place for content that has been identified as misinformation on Facebook and shared directly in Messenger. For more information, see How Facebook protects elections.
Foster a safer community
If you come across possible harmful content or behaviour, such as harassment or impersonation, please report it. If we see that it violates our Community Standards, we'll take appropriate action, which could include disabling their account or limiting their ability to send messages.
Enhance safeguards for minors
Keeping minors safe on our platforms is one of our greatest responsibilities. We automatically provide enhanced safety features for minors, such as limiting who can message them and how they can be found in search, and offer them education and resources. We also use machine learning to detect and disable accounts who are engaging in inappropriate interactions with children.
Review and enforce
Reporting is an essential tool for responding to abuse effectively and preventing further harm. Reports are prioritised based on the severity of harm, which allows us to respond quickly to issues such as exploitation or child safety.","helping to keep you safe messenger helps to keep you safe online. that's why we're constantly working to stop malicious activity before it reaches you. here are the ways we work to protect your safety on messenger reduce unwanted interactions we filter potentially harmful messages so they don't reach your inbox. safety notices may pop up in your chats to help you spot potential scams or imposters, and we detect and block millions of fake accounts on facebook every day. control who you let in messenger continuously innovates to protect you from harm, and tools like multiblock help you control your experience. you decide who reaches your chats list, who goes to your message request folder, and who can't message or call you at all. reduce the spread of misinformation to help reduce the spread of viral misinformation and harmful content, we limit the number of chats that a message can be forwarded to at one time. we also have additional protections in place for content that has been identified as misinformation on facebook and shared directly in messenger. for more information, see how facebook protects elections. foster a safer community if you come across possible harmful content or behaviour, such as harassment or impersonation, please report it. if we see that it violates our community standards, we'll take appropriate action, which could include disabling their account or limiting their ability to send messages. enhance safeguards for minors keeping minors safe on our platforms is one of our greatest responsibilities. we automatically provide enhanced safety features for minors, such as limiting who can message them and how they can be found in search, and offer them education and resources. we also use machine learning to detect and disable accounts who are engaging in inappropriate interactions with children. review and enforce reporting is an essential tool for responding to abuse effectively and preventing further harm. reports are prioritised based on the severity of harm, which allows us to respond quickly to issues such as exploitation or child safety.",[]
