Effective from 26 June 2024 | View printable version | See previous versions
Highlights
We at Meta want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. That's why we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. This helps you use Meta Products in the way that's right for you.
In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain and transfer information. We also let you know your rights. Each section of the Policy includes helpful examples and simpler language to make our practices easier to understand. We've also added links to resources where you can learn more about the privacy topics that interest you.
It's important to us that you know how to control your privacy, so we also show you where you can manage your information in the settings of the Meta Products you use. You can update these settings to shape your experience.

What information do we collect?
Highlights
The information that we collect and process about you depends on how you use our Products. For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you post a reel on Instagram. When you use our products, we collect some information about you even if you don't have an account.
Here's the information we collect:
Your activity and information that you provide
Friends, followers and other connections
App, browser and device information
Information from partners, vendors and other third parties
What if you don't let us collect certain information?
Some information is required for our products to work. Other information is optional, but without it, the quality of your experience might be affected.

What if the information that we collect doesn't identify individuals?
In some cases information is de-identified, aggregated or anonymised by third parties so that it no longer identifies individuals before it's made available to us. We use this information as described below without trying to re-identify individuals.

What information do we collect?
Highlights
The information that we collect and process about you depends on how you use our Products.

Here's the information we collect:
Your activity and information that you provide
Friends, followers and other connections
App, browser and device information
Information from partners, vendors and other third parties
What if you don't let us collect certain information?
Some information is required for our products to work. Other information is optional, but without it, the quality of your experience might be affected.

What if the information that we collect doesn't identify individuals?
In some cases information is de-identified, aggregated or anonymised by third parties so that it no longer identifies individuals before it's made available to us. We use this information as described below without trying to re-identify individuals.
